That war is bad. War takes lives, ruins economies, divides nations and wreaks havoc in the world. History, social studies, life skills—in almost all of our classes they hammered the same thing into our heads.<p>We marched in formation, sang war songs and stood guard on every 23rd of February. We marched in ‘Immortal Regiment’, laid flowers at monuments and recited poems on every 9th of May. We watched films, read books and analysed history. All so that we could know about the horrors of war, honour the memory of our ancestors and not repeat the years 1941–1945.<p>This was obvious then, but it is also obvious now: all these actions were aimed not at fostering patriotism and pacifism, but at moral and physical preparation for a possible invasion by a Western enemy. In fact, that is what we were told; veiled, but still. We were taught that no one loves us and will be ready to attack at any opportunity.<p>But you know what we were never told during our school years, what wasn’t explained to us? It wasn’t explained to us why and for what reason Russia suddenly took over the Crimea—we were simply told to be happy about it. We were not told why the western regions of Ukraine decided to secede—we were told it was for the best. We were not told why Russia suddenly saw fit to interfere in the internal affairs of another country—we were ‘helping’. We were not told what exactly had been happening on the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts over ‘the last 8 years’—we are not told even now, but we are blamed for not understanding it.<p>We have not been taught to understand Russian politics and Putin’s plans, we have not been taught to understand the country’s foreign policy and economy. And those who have joined the army, the police or the Rosgvardia have not been taught how to fight. They tried to teach us to blindly believe in the regime and to hate everyone who thinks otherwise, to be wary of foreigners and to keep our heads down. But all they have succeeded in doing is sowing division in society. While some repost Sarik Andreasyan and call our once friendly people fascists, others are in a hurry to pack their suitcases, sell their possessions, empty ATMs and wait, perhaps, for the last flight out of Cheboksary to Istanbul.<p>Yes, we were taught to fear and despise war, we were taught to live in peace and some kind of democracy. Except that in 2022 these skills turned out to be absolutely useless.<p>We should have been learning English.</main><script async defer src=/lift.js></script><script async crossorigin data-goatcounter=https://kytta.goatcounter.com/count integrity=sha384-QGgNMMRFTi8ul5kHJ+vXysPe8gySvSA/Y3rpXZiRLzKPIw8CWY+a3ObKmQsyDr+a src=//gc.zgo.at/count.v3.js></script>
