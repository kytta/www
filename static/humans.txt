Me,

	— Nikita Karamov <me@kytta.dev>

authored the content of this website, wrote the code, and did most of the stuff,
which is logical, I guess.


These people helped me improve it by writing issues and authoring PRs:

	— Linus Kämmerer <linuskmr.dev@gmail.com>


These people inspired me to start a blog and to design it the way I designed it:

	— Rasmus Andersson (rsms.me)
	— Nikita Prokopov (tonsky.me)
	— Kev Quirk (kevquirk.com)
	— René Coignard, as he was known as Mikhail Podivilov (podivilov.ru)
	— Maxim Ilyahov (maximilyahov.ru)
	— Seirdy (seirdy.one)


These people created the software that powers the blog:

	— Vincent Prouillet (Zola)
