This is the source code for [www.kytta.dev][site] as well as all its content.

## Build

**Prerequisites:**

- [Zola], a static site generator
- (optional) [Skyr], a task runner

To build the website, run:

```sh
skyr  # or 'skyr build'
```

This will put the built site in the `public` directory.

To serve the website with livereload, run:

```sh
skyr serve
```

<summary>How to run scripts without Skyr</summary>

[Skyr] is just a runner for the scripts inside the `script` directory. Instead
of running `skyr`, you can run:

```sh
script/build
```
