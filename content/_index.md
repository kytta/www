Hello there, my name is Nikita, and I am a web developer. I do backend with
Django (or anything else Python-based) and frontend with Vue.js and Svelte(Kit).

## /donate

If, for some reason, you want to give me money, here are the means to do so:

- [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=L235MHK6CDKKS)
- [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/kytta)
- [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/kytta)

Alternatively, you can give me some imaginary web3-approved feel-good-tokens. Amongst the endless variations to choose from, I've settled on Monero. Here's my address ([QR](./monero.png)):
