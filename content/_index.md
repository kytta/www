title: "About me"
---

My name is Nikita, and I am a full-stack web developer and an average open-source software enjoyer. Among the things I've made are [Shareâ‚‚Fedi](https://github.com/kytta/share2fedi) and [Shareon](https://shareon.js.org/). In my free time, I watch way too much YouTube and read way too much Wikipedia.
