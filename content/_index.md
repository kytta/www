# @kytta
Hi, my name is Nikita, and I am a developer.

I mostly develop stuff for web; my areas of expertise are front-end shenanigans with tons of JavaScript/TypeScript, Svelte or Vue.js, or back-end adventures with Python-based Django or Flask.

I sometimes dip my toes into systems development, yet I am too dumb (or too old?) to understand Rust yet too cautious to experiment with C/C++. Though I do quite like Go. If one would consider the amount of university classes I've taken, I have a ton of experience with Java. Please don't make me touch it ever again.

I want to make this website look neat, but really, all this work I need to do to set up my environment in order to make a clean website from scratch is killing me. That's why I'm starting with the most barebones version that could ever exist: HTML with a tiny bit of CSS. One day it'll look better, I swear.

If you want to take a look at my projects, you can find all of them [on GitHub](https://github.com/kytta). I am currently migrating my code [to Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/kytta), but the GitHub repositories will remain available as main mirrors.
