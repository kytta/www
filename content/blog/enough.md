I'm tired of myself.

You see, I am a failed perfectionist. My brain is constantly between two sides of a weird spectrum: Either I am concentrating on tiny little details for way too long, or I have no interest in a project whatsoever. I can spend hours fine-tuning a config file to then leave the project with no functionality.

This is the reason I haven't started a blog until now. I was spending hours after hours trying to craft the perfect page layout and style, up to the point that I didn't want to blog anything. A few weeks, or months, later I'd return to the project to then find the style I made back in the day not what I want — and yet again I'm redoing the whole CSS instead of, well, writing.

Well, screw this. This is my blog now. Writing is now priority number one for me.

If I'll ever want to play around with the style, I can. I will, for that matter. But it's important that I never lose my ability to write. The site may look ugly now, but I assure you this will change (sooner or later).

And while I'm at it: This is post 001 of [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/). Let's get this started, shall we?
