title: Algeria is DZ, because it's Dzayer
description: (Almost) every country on Earth has a two-letter ISO code, and Algeria is no exception. Yet, its code is "DZ". Where do these seemingly unrelated letters come from?

I was working on the translations for my Fediverse share page (you can contribute [on Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/share2fedi/)), when I stumbled upon a language code I've never seen before: `ar-DZ`. It was clear that `ar` is Arabic, but what's `DZ`? A quick search in the ISO 3166 list showed that it was, in fact, Algeria. Okay, but why? I decided to find out.

**Note:** This page used to explain my search process. I have now omitted it for... <a href="/blog/why-is-algeria-dz-backstory/" rel="nofollow">reasons</a>.

## The answer

I have looked through countless Wikipedia articles until I've finally found what I was looking for. The answer to my question — _Why is Algeria's ISO 3166 code DZ?_ — lies in a very specific Wikipedia article: [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2). In it, it is said loud and clear:

> Code taken from name in Arabic <span lang="ar">الجزائر</span> _al-Djazā'ir_, Algerian Arabic <span lang="ar-DZ">الدزاير</span> _al-Dzāyīr_, or Berber <span lang="ber">ⴷⵣⴰⵢⵔ</span> _Dzayer_

When I posted this on the Fediverse, I've got some helpful replies that helped me refine this result. [ButterflyOfFire](https://mstdn.fr/@ButterflyOfFire) (who is from Algeria) said that the actual pronunciation is more like _Lezzayer_ (written <span lang="ber">ⵍⴻⵣⵣⴰⵢⴻⵔ</span>). And [lunabee](https://lunabee.space/) advised me to not use the word "berber", opting for "amazigh" when talking about the people, and "tamazight" when talking about the language.

So, once again:\
**Algeria's ISO 3166-2 code, DZ, comes from its Arabic and/or Tamazight name, which is al-Dzayir and Dzayer, respectively**.
